# Calendar

I feel like the most important part of the website is the calendar, so I moved it to the home page. It is also a Google Calendar so you can easily add events to your personal calendar.

### Pros:

* Users can add a Google Maps location for the event (Triton Statue/Center Hall etc.) </li>
* You can easily click to add the event to your personal calendar </li>

### Cons:

* The way event signups work right now would not work with the google events and would have to be adjusted. </li>
