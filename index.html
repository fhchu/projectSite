<h1 id="header-1">Calendar</h1>
<p>I feel like the most important part of the website is the calendar, so I moved it to the home page. It is also a Google Calendar so you can easily add events to your personal calendar. </p>
<h3> Pros: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Users can add a Google Maps location for the event (Triton Statue/Center Hall etc.) </li>
<li> You can easily click to add the event to your personal calendar </li>
</ul>
<h3> Cons: </h3>
<ul>
<li> The way event signups work right now would not work with the google events and would have to be adjusted. </li>
</ul>
